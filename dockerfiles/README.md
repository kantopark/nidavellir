Prebuilt Docker Runtimes
========================

The list of Dockerfile here contains a list of prebuilt docker images which can be used to
run your tasks. These images come pre-installed with common packages, executables and 
drivers. Using them could potentially save you from having to build your own images. Feel free
to try them out.
